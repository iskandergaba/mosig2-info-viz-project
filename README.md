# Information Visualization Project 2020-21 

A data information visualization project that seeks to help users visually answer a few questions regarding the data trends in a CO<sub>2</sub> emissions dataset of academic laboratory work travels with all identifying information anonymized using Game of Thrones character and location names.

## Visualizations
We propose two [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) visualizations:

- **[CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Grouped Bar Chart](viz/co2-bar-chart.html.html):** A dynamic grouped bar chart that details the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by different decompositions of travelers so as to understand the impact of the region, house, title, rank, and institution on the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
- **[CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions by Continent](viz/co2-bar-chart.html.html):** A muti-line plot that depicts the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions amont per continent destination over the years so as to understand the data trends of each continent destination and compare them to one another.

## Requirements
All what you need to run this project is a machine with [Python](https://www.python.org) and a JavaScript-capable modern browser (we recommend [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new)) installed.

## Running Instructions
- Unpack the project archive.
- In project root directory, start a web server using the command `python3 -m http.server`.
- Open in your web browser [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the project's landing page.
- Scroll down the **Visualizations** section. Each visualization is represented by a card with text explaining how the visualisations are answering the questions we chose (i.e. serving as a short report per visualization).
- To open visualization, click on the title on of the card and you will be redirected to the visualization page.
